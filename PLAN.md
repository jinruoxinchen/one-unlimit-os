## Technical Infrastructure Requirements

### Development Environment
- Android Studio with Kotlin support
- TensorFlow Lite and/or PyTorch Mobile for on-device inference
- Vector database system (e.g., Chroma, FAISS, or custom solution)
- Claude API integration tools

### Testing Environment
- Multiple Android test devices (various versions and manufacturers)
- Automated testing framework
- Performance monitoring tools
- Battery consumption analysis tools

### Cloud Infrastructure
- API gateway for LLM communication
- Authentication and user management system
- Analytics platform for usage monitoring
- Backup and synchronization services

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
1. **Accessibility Service Limitations**
   - *Risk*: Android may restrict what accessibility services can access or control
   - *Mitigation*: Design fallback mechanisms and alternative access methods

2. **Battery Consumption**
   - *Risk*: Continuous monitoring could significantly impact battery life
   - *Mitigation*: Implement intelligent activity scheduling and optimized polling

3. **OS Version Fragmentation**
   - *Risk*: Different Android versions may require different implementation approaches
   - *Mitigation*: Create abstraction layers and version-specific adapters

### Business Risks
1. **API Cost Management**
   - *Risk*: LLM API costs could scale unpredictably with usage
   - *Mitigation*: Implement local processing where possible and usage quotas

2. **User Adoption**
   - *Risk*: Users may be reluctant to grant extensive permissions
   - *Mitigation*: Create progressive permission model and clear value demonstrations

3. **Competitive Landscape**
   - *Risk*: Google or other major players may implement similar functionality
   - *Mitigation*: Focus on unique value propositions and specialized capabilities

## Success Metrics
