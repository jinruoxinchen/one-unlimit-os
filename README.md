# One Unlimited OS (一人无限操作系统)

> *One Person, Unlimited Potential* - AI-Native Middleware for Complete Android Control

## Overview

One Unlimited OS is a middleware layer that enables AI agents to control Android devices at a near-system level without requiring root access or operating system modifications. This project creates a bridge between large language models (LLMs) like Claude and the Android operating system, allowing AI to become a true partner in mobile computing.

## Core Vision

Traditional smartphone interfaces require human interaction at every step. Even with voice assistants, the experience remains fragmented and limited. One Unlimited OS reimagines this paradigm by allowing AI agents to directly:

- Access and control apps and system settings
- Perform complex task sequences autonomously  
- Understand context across applications
- Maintain persistent memory of user preferences and behaviors
- Provide truly personalized assistance based on deep system integration

## Key Features

### 🧠 Agent Framework
- Multi-agent architecture with specialized capabilities
- Agent memory and context management
- Character-based personas with customizable behaviors

### 🛠️ System Bridge
- Accessibility service-based system control
- Intent and activity management
- Content observation and manipulation

### 🔌 Tool Integration 
- Expandable tool ecosystem
- Standardized tool interfaces and protocols
- Developer API for creating custom tools

### 🔐 Security & Privacy
- Agent permission management
- Local processing prioritization
- User oversight and approval mechanisms

## Technical Approach

One Unlimited OS uses a middleware approach rather than creating a custom ROM, making it accessible to users without requiring device modification. The system leverages:

1. **Android Accessibility Services** - For broad system observation and control
2. **Intent Broadcasting** - For app launching and cross-app communication
3. **Background Services** - For agent persistence and task monitoring
4. **API Integration** - For direct communication with cloud LLMs
5. **Local Vector Database** - For efficient memory and context management

## Getting Started

> Note: This project is currently in early development and not yet ready for general use.

### Prerequisites
