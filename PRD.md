# One Unlimited OS: Product Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

One Unlimited OS is a middleware layer that enables AI agents to control Android devices at a near-system level without requiring root access or operating system modifications. This project creates a bridge between large language models (LLMs) like Claude and the Android operating system, allowing AI to become a true partner in mobile computing.

### Vision

Traditional smartphone interfaces require human interaction at every step. Even with voice assistants, the experience remains fragmented and limited. One Unlimited OS reimagines this paradigm by allowing AI agents to directly:

- Access and control apps and system settings
- Perform complex task sequences autonomously  
- Understand context across applications
- Maintain persistent memory of user preferences and behaviors
- Provide truly personalized assistance based on deep system integration

### Core Features

- **üß† Agent Framework**: Multi-agent architecture with specialized capabilities

- **üîå Tool Integration**: Expandable tool ecosystem
- **üîê Security & Privacy**: Agent permission management

## 2. System Architecture

The system follows a layered architecture approach:

1. **User Layer**: Interfaces for user interaction
2. **Agent Layer**: AI intelligence components
